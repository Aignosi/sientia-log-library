## Regression

### Overview

The `RegressionTracker` class, which extends the `BaseTracker`, is specifically designed to help users track regression models with ease. It simplifies the process of managing regression workflows by allowing users to log key components such as variable names, model hyperparameters, train/test split configurations, and the regression model itself.

This tracker is ideal for users who want a structured and intuitive way to monitor and log their regression experiments on the **SIENTIA edge AIOps platform**.
