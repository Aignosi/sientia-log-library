## Simple Tracker

### Overview

The `SimpleTracker` class, which inherits from `BaseTracker`, is designed to provide a minimal and user-friendly way to track models. It requires only the specification of a dataset name and input feature names, making it ideal for users who want a straightforward and hassle-free tracking experience.

This tracker is perfect for citizen data scientists and other users who need a simple yet effective tool to log their experiments on the **SIENTIA edge AIOps platform**.
